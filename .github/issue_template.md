### As soon as you're assigned

- [ ] Assign yourself this issue! (If you're not a member of [London Computation Club](https://github.com/computationclub) on GitHub, ask someone on Slack to add you.)
- [ ] Make sure you have access to the [Buffer](http://buffer.com) account for the club - this is how you'll tweet. (Ask on #general in Slack and someone will DM you the credentials.)
- [ ] Make sure you can commit to the Computation Club website repository (Ask on #general in Slack and an administrator will add you to the organisation.)

### The day after you're assigned

- [ ] Remove the previous meeting’s chapter from Slack (if scanned; you may need a Slack admin user to do this)
- [ ] Encourage a write up of the previous meeting in Slack
- [ ] Add a link to the previous meeting’s write up to the: 
  * [ ] [wiki homepage](https://github.com/computationclub/computationclub.github.io/wiki/Home/_edit)
  * [ ] [wiki sidebar](https://github.com/computationclub/computationclub.github.io/wiki/_Sidebar/_edit)
  * [ ] [meetings.yml file](https://github.com/computationclub/computationclub.github.io/edit/master/_data/meetings.yml)
- [ ] Announce the write-up!
  * [ ] Slack
  * [ ] The mailing list
  * [ ] Twitter

### Same day / A few days later (but not too long!)

- [ ] Double check with Leo that Geckoboard is able to host on the planned date; if not:
  * [ ] Make a Doodle poll with potential dates
  * [ ] Announce the poll on Slack
  * [ ] Announce the poll on the mailing list
  * [ ] Announce the poll on Twitter
  * [ ] Pick a date
- [ ] Identify the next chapter(s) to read for the next meeting (or any reading material for a non-book meeting)
- [ ] Create an online event using an appropriate service that allows us to measure attendance.  We prefer to add it to [Attending.io](https://attending.io) as Lanyrd is too unreliable. Add information about how to access the venue (e.g. entering through HelloFresh).
- [ ] Announce the meeting!
  * [ ] Slack
  * [ ] The [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/london-computation-club)
  * [ ] Twitter
- [ ] Add the next meeting to the Computation Club website by [editing the meetings.yml file](https://github.com/computationclub/computationclub.github.io/edit/master/_data/meetings.yml). Make sure your YAML is well-formatted - don't leave any colons in titles, for example!
- [ ] Try to get a copy of the chapter scanned and put it on Slack as a single .pdf file ([Office Lens](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/office-lens/id975925059?mt=8) app might be useful to "scan" chapters with your phone)

### A day or two before the meeting

- [ ] Remind people about the next meeting
  * [ ] Slack
  * [ ] The [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/london-computation-club)
  * [ ] Twitter
- [ ] Find a volunteer to open and close the meeting using our [standard opening](https://github.com/computationclub/computationclub.github.io/wiki/Starting-a-meeting) and [closing remarks](https://github.com/computationclub/computationclub.github.io/wiki/Running-a-retrospective)
- [ ] Find a volunteer to share the chapter during the meeting via AirPlay
- [ ] Find a volunteer for REPL exercises via AirPlay
- [ ] Find a volunteer to take notes
- [ ] [Update the meeting checklist template](https://github.com/computationclub/computationclub.github.io/edit/master/.github/issue_template.md) based on your experiences using it. Maybe we've missed something, or the timings need to be improved?
- [ ] Open a new issue with the above template, called "Organise next meeting".

### At the meeting

- [ ] Pick an organizer for the next meeting

### Finally

- [ ] Mark this issue as done! Excellently executed!
